OLD README

Salt Stack formula for managing timzone configuration.  Please find the official timezone-formula at the following URL.

<https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/timezone-formula>

This formula was created as a stopgap because the existing timezone-formula does not seem to work for Fedora 24.  Please use the official formula as this one may disappear after some additional troubleshooting of the aforementioned.
